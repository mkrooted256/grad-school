Note that unlike in the directed case, we are not saying anything about how one variable is generated from another set of variables (as a conditional probability distribution would do). We simply indicate a level of coupling between dependent variables in the graph. In a sense, this requires less prior knowledge, as we no longer have to specify a full generative story of how the vote of B is constructed from the vote of A

They also possess several important drawbacks:
- Computing the normalization constant 
- Z requires summing over a potentially exponential number of assignments. We will see that in the general case, this will be NP-hard; thus many undirected models will be intractable and will require approximation techniques.
- Undirected models may be difficult to interpret.
- It is much easier to generate data from a Bayesian network, which is important in some applications.
