## SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA25)
January 13–15 , 2025  
New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.  
https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/sosa25/

Support: general SIAM support, https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/conference-support/travel-and-registration-support/

An ideal submission will advance our understanding of an algorithmic problem by, for example, introducing a simpler algorithm, presenting a simpler analysis of an existing algorithm, or offering insights that generally simplify our understanding of important algorithms or computational problems.

We are especially interested in papers that make material more accessible to a wider audience, such as undergraduates, or for more specialized topics, general algorithms researchers.

## SIAM Conference on Applied Algebraic Geometry (AG25)

The scope includes theoretical analysis, as well as experimental validation, of discrete algorithms, and the mathematical problems related to their development or limitations. The scope also includes aspects of combinatorics and discrete mathematics related to discrete algorithms. Papers that raise important algorithmic problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged.
